# Caspio Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation of a simplified Caspio architecture for the SanMar Inventory App. The solution uses three tables to manage product data, inventory, and pricing information.

## Table Structure

### 1. Sanmar_Bulk_251816_Feb2024 Table

This existing table contains all product data from SanMar, including:
- STYLE
- PRODUCT_TITLE
- CATEGORY_NAME
- SUBCATEGORY_NAME
- COLOR_NAME
- SIZE
- BRAND_NAME
- FRONT_MODEL (product images)
- And many other product-related fields

### 2. Inventory Table

This table tracks inventory levels by warehouse:
- INVENTORY_ID (Autonumber, Primary Key)
- STYLE (Text, 255)
- COLOR_NAME (Text, 255)
- SIZE (Text, 255)
- WAREHOUSE_ID (Text, 255)
- QUANTITY (Number)
- LAST_UPDATED (Date/Time)

### 3. Pricing Table

This table stores up-to-date pricing information:
- PRICING_ID (Autonumber, Primary Key)
- STYLE (Text, 255)
- COLOR_NAME (Text, 255)
- SIZE (Text, 255)
- PIECE_PRICE (Currency)
- CASE_PRICE (Currency)
- CASE_SIZE (Number)
- PROGRAM_PRICE (Currency)
- LAST_UPDATED (Timestamp)

## Table Relationships

These tables are related through common fields (STYLE, COLOR_NAME, SIZE). In Caspio, these relationships are established through:

1. **Virtual relationships** in DataPages
2. **Views** that join the tables
3. **Application code** that queries and combines data from multiple tables

## Implementation Components

### 1. Daily Import Script

The `daily_inventory_pricing_import.py` script:
- Fetches inventory data from SanMar API
- Fetches pricing data from SanMar API
- Updates the Inventory table
- Updates the Pricing table

This script should be scheduled to run daily to keep both inventory and pricing information up-to-date.

### 2. Flask Application Routes

The `app_caspio_pricing.py` module provides routes that:
- Query product information from Sanmar_Bulk
- Query inventory data from Inventory
- Query pricing data from Pricing
- Combine the data for display

### 3. Product Detail Template

The `product_detail_with_pricing.html` template displays:
- Product details
- Color and size options
- Pricing information
- Inventory availability

## Benefits of This Architecture

1. **Simplified Data Management**
   - No duplicate product data
   - Clear separation of concerns

2. **Optimized Updates**
   - Product data rarely changes
   - Inventory and pricing update frequently
   - Each table can be updated independently

3. **Improved Performance**
   - Each table is optimized for its specific purpose
   - Indexes can be created for common queries

4. **Data Integrity**
   - Consistent product information
   - Up-to-date inventory and pricing

## Implementation Steps

1. ✅ **Create the Inventory Table** (Completed)
2. ✅ **Create the Pricing Table** (Completed)
3. **Set Up Table Relationships**
   - Create indexes on (STYLE, COLOR_NAME, SIZE) in all tables
   - Create virtual relationships in DataPages

4. **Deploy the Daily Import Script**
   - Configure environment variables
   - Schedule the script to run daily

5. **Integrate the Application Code**
   - Add the Flask routes to your application
   - Implement the product detail template

6. **Test the Solution**
   - Verify data import
   - Test the application
   - Monitor performance

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a streamlined architecture that leverages the existing Sanmar_Bulk table while adding dedicated tables for inventory and pricing data. The solution is designed to be maintainable, performant, and flexible.

By using this approach, you eliminate the need for a separate Products table while ensuring that inventory and pricing information is always up-to-date.
